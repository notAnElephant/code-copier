## Additional notes ##

This plugin is a fork of [icelam/code-copier](https://github.com/icelam/code-copier), but as the original
author didn't maintain it and it got removed from the Chrome Web Store, I decided to create a new repository
to keep it up to date. All functionality is the original author's work.

## Development Notes ##
* Setup: `yarn install`
* Development: `yarn run dev`
* Build: `yarn run build`
* Build and zip: `yarn run pack`
